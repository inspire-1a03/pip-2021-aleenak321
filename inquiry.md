# Self-directed inquiry

## 1. Inquiry 1

> Q1: The provinces I have personally travelled to and lived in consist of Ontario, Quebec, and Alberta. I wonder how these specific provinces compare in regards to visits to groceries and pharmacies throughout the pandemic?

#### Summary

Out of the provinces I have travelled to, it seems as though they all follow generally the same trend of heavily decreasing visits to groceries and pharmacies during the beginning of the three waves, but begin to increase visitations in May of 2021. This could be because of vaccination rollout, causing people to visit pharmacies more often. I find it interesting that Alberta has the average highest amount of visits, but unsurprised that Quebec has the lowest since Quebec's situation was dire during the pandemic.

## 2. Inquiry 2

> Q2: Out of all the provinces, I wonder which ones have the greatest and lowest amount of total vaccines. What could this mean?

#### Summary
From my chloropleth map, I can easily distinguish the fact that Ontario holds the highest amount of vaccines, with a total of 7,735,149. The lowest amount is 30,824, which is possessed by Nunavut. With this information alone, I can infer that Ontario might have a higher amount of cases than the other provinces, while Nunavut may have the least.

> Q3: How does the Ontarion visitation rate to workplaces compare and contrast to the average during the pandemic?

#### Summary
I am astonished at the fact that Ontario followed the average trend for the rest of the country, given that Ontario is Canada's most populated province. I find it relieving that there are drops in visitations to workplaces in correlation to the three waves, yet it is also alarming because this chart may reflect a serious concern as employment rate continues to drop, and as Canadians continue to struggle with going back to work. It is also troubling to see that Ontario is doing slightly worse than the average around June 1, 2021, though this might be due to high vaccination count.
