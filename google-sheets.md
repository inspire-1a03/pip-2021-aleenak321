# Exploring COVID-19 patterns with Google Sheets

## 1. Trends in national case data
> Q1: How has daily COVID-19 cases, hospitalizations and deaths changed in Canada over time since the beginning of the pandemic?

#### Summary
The three trends shown are synchronized quite well with each other in correspondance to the pandemic's three waves, showing evident spikes for cases though fatalities and hospitalizations decrease soon after. This could be explained with the fact that hospitals continue to increase in capacity, or as cases increase, more people are getting vaccinated, thus decreasing the spread of the vaccine.

## 2. Ontario's testing and vaccination trends 
> Q2: How has Ontario responded to COVID in terms of testing and vaccinations?

#### Summary
As the number of people getting tested per 100 people increases, so does the amount of vaccinations per 100 people. Though it is important to note that the amount of people getting vaccinated started only a little later on throughout the pandemic; during 2021. Both variables are increasing proportionately.

## 3. Vaccination rates across provinces and territories
> Q3: How do vaccination rates over time compare between all provinces and territories?

#### Summary
Generally, all provinces are increasing exponentially in terms of vaccination rates. Though, it is noted that Quebec and Manitoba most closely resemble an exponential pattern, whereas the other provinces are nearly increasing logarithmically. This may be because the cases in Quebec, and potentially Manitoba, are some of the worst of the pandemic; thus allowing for a quick and desperate vaccination rollout.
