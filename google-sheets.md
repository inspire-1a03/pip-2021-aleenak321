# Exploring COVID-19 patterns with Google Sheets

## 1. Trends in national case data
> Q1: How has daily COVID-19 cases, hospitalizations and deaths changed in Canada over time since the beginning of the pandemic?

#### Summary
The three trends shown are synchronized quite well with each other in correspondance to the pandemic's three waves, showing evident spikes for cases though fatalities and hospitalizations decrease soon after. This could be explained with the fact that hospitals continue to increase in capacity, or as cases increase, more people are getting vaccinated, thus decreasing the spread of the vaccine.

## 2. Ontario's testing and vaccination trends 
> Q2: How has Ontario responded to COVID in terms of testing and vaccinations?

#### Summary
As the number of people getting tested per 100 people increases, so does the amount of vaccinations per 100 people. Though it is important to note that the amount of people getting vaccinated started only a little later on throughout the pandemic; during 2021. Both variables are increasing proportionately.

## 3. Vaccination rates across provinces and territories
> Q3: How do vaccination rates over time compare between all provinces and territories?

#### Summary
Generally, all provinces are increasing exponentially in terms of vaccination rates. Though, it is noted that Quebec and Manitoba most closely resemble an exponential pattern, whereas the other provinces are nearly increasing logarithmically. This may be because the cases in Quebec, and potentially Manitoba, are some of the worst of the pandemic; thus allowing for a quick and desperate vaccination rollout.

## 4. Canadian mobility trends 
> Q4. How has mobility changed in Canada over the pandemic?

#### Summary
Mobility across the country has only a little around the beginning of the pandemic, but visits to parks shows a spike and then decreases to baseline along all the other trends, only to spike again after May 2021. This can be explained through the vaccination rollout rate; the more citizens are getting vaccinated, the safer they feel to return to parks and other areas again.

## Final reflection
> What inferences can you make from the data you have explored and visualized? 
> What questions still exist about the trends and the data? What new questions has this process generated? 
> What additional information would you like to help answer these questions? 


Some inferences I can make is that in general, Canada has taken the COVID-19 pandemic quite seriously. This is evident in my “Tracking Canada’s COVID-19 Cases, Hospitalizations, and Fatalities” chart, where, around May 1st 2021, we see a drop in fatalities and hospitalizations though cases continue to increase. I can infer that though the spread is relevant, more and more people are getting vaccinated and not needing to visit the hospital. Also, the vaccination rates have been increasing almost exponentially for all provinces, as shown in my timeline chart. Lastly, a decrease in the amount of people visiting the parks is evident in my Mobility chart. Some questions that remain are “What specific population of Canada are the outliers?” and “Which province is falling most behind in vaccinations?” I can answer these questions if I have information on the population of Canada that does not believe in COVID vaccines, specifying what age range that population is. The second question may be answered with my timeline chart.
