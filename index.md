# Welcome to my Project Page!

This website has been created by Aleena Khan as part of the **Patterns in the Pandemic** module of INSPIRE 1A03. 

On the topic of the COVID-19 pandemic, I have always found the mental health of teenagers amongst this difficult time to be of personal interest to me.

Please feel free to view this short video on how teenagers are expressing their struggles throughout these terrible times.
