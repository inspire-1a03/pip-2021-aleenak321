# Exercise 3: Advanced visualization using Tableau


## 1. Mapping regional vaccination rates
> Q1: What is the current state of vaccinations among provinces and territories?

#### Summary
The current state of the vaccination rollout among the provinces and territories is quite personally pleasant to view. It seems as though majority of Canadians are willing to receive the vaccine, and it is notable that the Northern territories have a higher vaccine rollout rate than the Southern provinces.

## 2. Changes in travel to retail and recreation destinations for provinces/territories
> Q2: How has travel to recreation and retail locations changed over time between regions of Canada?

#### Summary
All regions of Canada follow the generic trend of dropping activity in visiting retail and recreation sites when the 1st, 2nd, and 3rd wave hit; especially during the 1st wave. Though most regions followed through during the 2nd and 3rd waves, PEI and Newfoundland made more retail and recreation visits as compared to the others. Northwest Territories, Ontario, and Saskatchewan appeared amongst the lowest of visits, whereas PEI seemed to be an outlier, with the most visits immediately after the 1st wave.

## 3. Changes in travel to parks for Ontario counties/municipalities
> Q3: How has travel to parks changed over time in Ontario's counties/municipalities?  

<!-- Paste your embed code for your figure below-->

#### Summary
All of Ontario’s municipalities follow the generic trend of spiking around August 1st, 2020, with visits to parks being at an all-time high, though they decreased considerably immediately after. It is interesting to see that visits to parks are increasing for all municipalities on April 1st, 2021; around when vaccinations began to be released.

## 4. Reflection 
> What are your initial thoughts about using Tableau vs. Google Sheets? What might be the advantages of each? 
> What inferences can you make from the Mobility data that you explored and visualized? 
> What new questions would you like to ask of the data? 
> How might you use these two datasets together to perform new analyses? 

My initial thoughts of Google Sheets is that it was very simple and easy to follow, and not overcomplicated. I quite enjoy using it more than Excel. Tableau was also simple, though intimidating at first, but displayed an easy way to view data and communicate information. Advantages of each are that they are both simplistic and quick to use. Google Sheets allows users to see numbers at work, whereas Tableau does a better job at visualization. 



The inferences I can make from the Mobility data are that all Canadians are following the same generic trend of increasing visits and activities directly after the COVID waves hit, but then slightly increasing their mobilities again. I noticed that a more considerable increase was found around the time of the vaccine release, which makes sense since civilians feel more safe to travel outside. 

In regards to provinces I have personally been to, how are the visitations amongst Grocery and Pharmacies? Which province is doing the best, and which is doing the worst, considering vaccine rollouts? 

I can use these two datasets together by extracting my data that I already have on Google Sheets, and visualizing it onto Tableau to understand and formulate answers to my rough questions.
